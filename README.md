##Simulation Environment for Computer Systems
#Description

This project provides a simulation environment for computer systems. It takes the characteristics of various stations (such as CPU, disk, outgoing link, etc.) and returns a comprehensive workload analysis. The system is designed to help understand and evaluate the performance and behavior of computer systems under different configurations and workloads.
Features

`    Simulates multiple stations including CPU, disk, and network links.
`    Takes customizable input parameters for each station.
`    Provides detailed workload analysis and performance metrics.
`    Implemented in Python for ease of use and flexibility.
